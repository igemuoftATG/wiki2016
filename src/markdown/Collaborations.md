We collaborated with iGEM Concordia to validate the functionality of our constructs BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. We have shipped our DNA samples to Concordia iGem on September 2016. Following protocol was executed by iGem Concordia for the preliminary results:

1. Transformed E.Coli DH5a cells with BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002 separately.
2. For control groups untransformed E.Coli DH5a cells were used.
3. 10uM and 100uM gold(III) metal ions were added to the control and experimental groups along with XGal
4. Blue color change was observed.

#### Results:
After the 2-3 hours, visible blue color was observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048001. Faint blue color was also observed in 10uM and 100uM tubes containing E.Coli BBa_K2048002. 

After 24h, tubes with BBa_K2048002 device also showed dark blue color. In addition, BBa_K2048002 tubes had a darker visible blue compared to BBa_K2048001. 

Concordia iGEM teams results further validated the functionality of our devices BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002. Moreover, they proved the expression levels can be observed at 100uM gold(III) levels in presence of XGal.


### Wiki Generator Collaboration:
We helped following teams for designing their wiki:

Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.

Which other teams can we work with?

You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.

In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.

Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:

*   Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
*   Characterize another team's part
*   Debug a construct
*   Model or simulating another team's system
*   Test another team's software
*   Help build and test another team's hardware project
*   Mentor a high-school team -->
