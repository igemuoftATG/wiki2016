### Success

* Both [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) and [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001) constructs responded to gold concentrations in a dose-responsive manner up to 1uM 
* [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) is more responsive to gold than copper

* [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001) is more responsive to both gold and copper concentrations than York 2013 construct (BBa_K1127008)

We expected to see a linear increase correlated to increase in the concentration. However, instead, we observed a sudden decrease in expression levels after 0.5uM. This became more pronounced over time, resulting a Range Detector Circuit.

We suspect that there is an inherent edge that represses the expression after a certain threshold. This would produce the circuit shown in Figure 4. We speculated that this effect might be minimum for cell free extracts that contain minimal enzymes.

### Not so successful

* Cell-free assay required more time and troubleshooting.

### Future plans

* Make cell-free assays work.


<!--INGORE THIS STUFF, THIS FOR ME TO FINISH LATER WHEN I HAS ALL EXCEL FILES-->

The iGEM Toronto 2016 team was successful at modifying an naturally existing transcription factor, GolS (natively found in *Salmonella enterica*), to contain certain mutations that have been found to cause CueR (a copper-response factor in *Escherichia coli*)to increase sensitivity to gold and significantly decrease it's sensitivity to copper. This modification was due to an amino acid change from proline to alanine at site 118. This successful synthetic change can be found composite BioBricks, [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) compared to the unchanged [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001).

Project Achievements

You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.

*   A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
*   A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.
