Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.

##### What should this page contain?

*   Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
*   Future plans for the project
*   Considerations for replicating the experiments

##### Project Achievements

You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.

*   A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
*   A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

# Results

### Success

* Both [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) and [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001) constructs responded to gold concentrations in a dose-responsive manner up to 1uM 
* [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) is more responsive to gold than copper

* [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001) is more responsive to both gold and copper concentrations than York 2013 construct (BBa_K1127008)

### Not so successful

* Cell-free assay did not work

### Future plans

* Make cell-free assays work


INGORE THIS STUFF, THIS FOR ME TO FINISH LATER WHEN I HAS ALL EXCEL FILES

The iGEM Toronto 2016 team was successful at modifying an naturally existing transcription factor, GolS (natively found in *Salmonella enterica*), to contain certain mutations that have been found to cause CueR (a copper-response factor in *Escherichia coli*)to increase sensitivity to gold and significantly decrease it's sensitivity to copper. This modification was due to an amino acid change from proline to alanine at site 118. This successful synthetic change can be found composite BioBricks, [Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048002) compared to the unchanged [Long GolS (BBa_K2048001)](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2048001).
