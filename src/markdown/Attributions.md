### Laboratory 

##### Endang (Susie) Susilawati - *Lab Manager*
Susie provided us with information regarding safety, training, supplies and ordering. She was our rescuer when we needed urgent reagents or needed help with regarding the equipments. Susie's support was crucial for us to perform daily wet lab activities.

##### Christian Euler - *Biozone PhD Student*
Christian provided feedback on our progress in the weekly meetings. He helped us with ordering reagents that are crucial to our projects and provided guidance on protocols.

##### Kayla Nemr - *Biozone PhD Student* 
Kayla helped us troubleshooting when we needed the most. She played a major role in getting rid off major rode blocks in our project. These include troubleshooting ligations and assays.

##### Naveen Venayak - *Biozone PhD Student*
Naveen provided guidance in designing sequence primers. He had the talent to understand how the project is progressing from our expressions and did his best to help.

##### Keith Pardee - *Assistant Professor, University of Toronto Pharmacy Department*
Keith halped us with designing Cell-Free Paper Based assays. As the author of the paper "Paper Based Cell-Free Gene Networks", he shared his protocols and helped troubleshooting.

##### Sean Caffrey - *Executive Director, Biozone*
Sean helped us secure a laboratory space for our project. He provided guidance on how to succeed in iGEM. 


### Computational

##### John DiMarco - *Director of Information Technology, University of Toronto*
John provided us with a high end graphics card for the server used by the Computational Team. Without his generous contribution, it would have been impossible to run the many of the GPU intensive computational tasks.

##### Guolivia Yuxiu - *Pardee lab Member, University of Toronto Pharmacy Department*
Livia was tremendously cooperative in the development of the Camera App for colorimetric analysis. During multiple online meetings, she was very insightful when discussing the application’s algorithms and provided us with helpful datasets.

### Policy and Practices

##### Dr. Kevin Kain - *Director, SAR Laboratories and Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto, and holds a Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in Molecular Parasitology*
We interviewed Dr. Kain about his research in malaria RDTs and community health engagement practices.

##### Dr. Ian Crandall - *Associate Professor, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy*
We interviewed Dr. Ian Crandall about the parasitology of malaria and how to use incentive models to maximize the likelihood of human cooperation.

##### Dr. Clive Shiff - *Associate Professor, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health*
We interviewed Dr. Clive Shiff about malaria RDTs and received feedback on environmental effects and sustainability.

##### Zoë Robaey - *Researcher, Department of Research and Dialogue, Rathenau Institut*
Our main contact for the Synenergene collaboration, Zoë provided helpful information about how to write application and techno-moral scenarios.

##### Dr. Todd Kuiken - *Senior Program Associate and Co-Director of Biology Collectives, Science and Technology Innovation Program, Wilson Center*
We hosted a Skype call with Dr. Kuiken who gave us feedback about our Human Practices project design

##### Dr. Peter Pennefather - *Associate Professor, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy*
A panelist for our Synthetic Biology Conversation Café event

##### Dr. Bob Logan - *Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto*
A panelist for our Synthetic Biology Conversation Café event

##### Christian Donohoe - *3rd year MChem Chemistry, iGEM Cardiff*
A panelist for our Synthetic Biology Conversation Café event


<!-- ★ ALERT!

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the [Attributions bronze criterion](http://2016.igem.org/Judging/Medals).

Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at [Instructions for Pages for awards](http://2016.igem.org/Judging/Pages_for_Awards/Instructions).

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.

Why is this page needed?

The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

What should this page have?

*   General Support
*   Project support and advice
*   Fundraising help and advice
*   Lab support
*   Difficult technique support
*   Project advisor support
*   Wiki support
*   Presentation coaching
*   Human Practices support
*   Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team

Can we base our project on a previous one?

Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, **as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.**

##### Team training and Project start

Tell us if your institution teaches an iGEM or synthetic biology class and when you started your project:

*   Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
*   When did you start this course?
*   Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
*   When did you start your brainstorming?
*   When did you start in the lab?
*   When did you start working on your project?  -->
